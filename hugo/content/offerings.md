Westover helps clients discover, unlock and pursue strategy. We offer a range of strategy services, customized to client needs and resources:

**Strategy Assessment**<br/>
Westover’s objective strategy assessment helps clients appreciate how gaps in their Strategic Plan may present barriers to sustainable growth. 

**Strategy Maps**<br/>
Westover works with companies to articulate the mission, vision, and values and establish measurable objectives for four key perspectives on a one-page Strategy Map. The Strategy Map brings needed clarity to the company’s priorities and is an effective tool to communicate with and align the organization around the new direction.

**Strategic Planning**<br/>
Where a more in-depth approach is needed, Westover works with clients to expand on the Strategy Map and develop more detailed, well-considered 3 to 5-year Strategic Plans, including specific Strategic Initiatives, metrics and timeframe. Advice on communication and execution is also provided. 

**Strategy Execution**<br/>
Westover provides leadership and resources to clients that may require external support in accomplishing aspects of their Strategic Plan.

**Board Performance Enhancement**<br/>
A hallmark of successful organizations is a board that is a Strategic Asset. Westover works with boards to enhance their performance and become and remain a Strategic Asset for the company.
