## Challenge
The Memorial Art Gallery (MAG) had recently appointed Jonathan Binstock as its new director. The MAG Board of Managers decided to hire an outside consultant to work with the director, senior staff and board on a strategic plan. The museum world had changed significantly since the most recent plan and the economic environment had deteriorated. Like many museums, MAG faced financial, technical, customer engagement and cultural challenges.  

## Approach
As a first step, Westover Strategy proposed developing a one-page 4-year Strategy Map with the senior staff, using the Balanced Scorecard methodology. The MAP would reflect the Mission, Vision and Values, as well as measurable objectives within four perspectives:  Financial/Value impact, Customer, Internal Processes and People and Culture. 

## Results
After the Board of Managers approved the Strategy Map, Director Jonathan Binstock presented the Map to all employees, explaining how their individual roles support the museumâ€™s mission. The Map is used regularly to educate new employees, board members and volunteers and to confirm whether projects fit with the strategic direction reflected there. As a next step in the Strategic Planning process, Westover was engaged to develop a deep dive [Strategic Plan]({{< relref "work/memorial-art-gallery/strategic-plan.md" >}}) for the museum.
