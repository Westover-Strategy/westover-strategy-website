## Challenge
The Center for Community Health was approaching the 10th anniversary of its establishment. The center had grown rapidly during its first 10 years as it sought to prevent disease and improve health.  A strategy update was needed to more accurately reflect the center’s direction and priorities. Center Director Dr. Nancy Bennett asked Westover to propose an approach to work with the senior team on the project.

## Approach
Westover proposed building a one-page 5-Year Strategy Map to articulate the center’s Mission, Vision and Values, and measurable objectives in four perspectives: Value Impact, Stakeholder, Internal Processes and People and Culture. Westover facilitated sessions with members of the senior staff to define the elements of the Strategy Map. Westover also recommended that Dr. Bennett form an Advisory Council to meet regularly and advise the center.

## Results
The Strategy Map is a valuable tool for the Center for Community Health, used to communicate the center’s direction to its many stakeholders, including its parent organization, clients, funders, colleagues, staff and community. The Map is used to help the center continue to pioneer ways to improve community health, based on research, services, education, and policy. Westover CEO, Susan Byrd, is an active member of the Advisory Council.
