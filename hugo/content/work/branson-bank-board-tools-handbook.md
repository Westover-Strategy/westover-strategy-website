### Challenge
Branson Bank Board Chair, Peter Peitz, proposed engaging a consultant to help the bank board become high-performing. A high-performing board would provide the bank a competitive advantage to continue its impressive growth, serve both its associates and its community and increase shareholder value. 

### Approach
Westover Strategy was engaged to assess the current state of the bank board and develop a set of customized high-performance board tools and a digital handbook for current and future board members. Westover met with all members of the board and senior staff and reviewed a wide range of bank documents to understand current policies and practices and identify areas for improvement. 

### Results
Tools developed by Westover for the bank board include: a summary of policies and practices, substantive topics of focus, specific expectations of board members, a board calendar, self-assessments, peer-assessments, board composition framework, board committees and board service terms. 

The customized tools were compiled in a digital handbook, which was launched and approved enthusiastically by the Branson Bank Board. The digital handbook is a living document, updated periodically and valued by both board and staff.
