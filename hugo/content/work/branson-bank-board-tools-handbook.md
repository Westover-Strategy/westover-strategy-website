      The activities during Susan Byrdâ€™s visit <to launch the High Performance
      Board Handbook> the comments made, the body language, show that Susan is
      respected and liked by our whole team. Susan earned our respect, we like
      her ways of leading and persuasion and are thankful that we kept the

### Challenge

Branson Bank Board Chair, Peter Peitz, proposed engaging a consultant to help the bank board become high-performing. A high-performing board would provide the bank a competitive advantage to continue its impressive growth, serve both its associates and its community and increase shareholder value.

### Approach

Westover Strategy was engaged to assess the current state of the bank board and develop a set of customized high-performance board tools and a digital handbook for current and future board members. Westover met with all members of the board and senior staff and reviewed a wide range of bank documents to understand current policies and practices and identify areas for improvement.

### Results

Tools developed by Westover for the bank board include: a summary of policies and practices, substantive topics of focus, specific expectations of board members, a board calendar, self-assessments, peer-assessments, board composition framework, board committees and board service terms.

The customized tools were compiled in a digital handbook, which was launched and approved enthusiastically by the Branson Bank Board. The digital handbook is a living document, updated periodically and valued by both board and staff.
