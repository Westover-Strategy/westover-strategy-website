### Challenge
A major health insurance company had an employee benefits
affiliate, Lifetime Benefit Solutions, that was struggling with growth and
operational issues. The company is the product of acquisitions that had been integrated
into one company that operated fairly autonomously from the parent.Â  Westover was engaged by Lifetime Benefit
Solutions President Tom Cauthorn to help the company to achieve its potential
as a strategic asset for the parent company. 

### Approach
Westover facilitated the development of a Three-Year Strategic
Plan, leveraging its earlier work producing a Strategy Map. The senior staff of
Lifetime Benefit Solutions, as well as key members of the parent company,
participated in the development of the Plan. 

### Result
The
Strategic Plan incorporates market research and analysis, parent company
feedback and direction, staff input and Westover internal and external
assessments. It was presented to the senior staff at an offsite facilitated by Westover,
and is being executed successfully. Westover provides ongoing advice and
support on plan execution to President Tom Cauthorn.
