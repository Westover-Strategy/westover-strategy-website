### Challenge
A large health insurance company had an employee benefits
affiliate, Lifetime Benefit Solutions that was struggling with growth and
operational issues. The company is the product of acquisitions that had been integrated
into one company that operated autonomously from the parent.  Westover was engaged by Lifetime Benefit
Solutions President Tom Cauthorn to help the company to achieve its potential
as a strategic asset for the parent company.

### Approach
As a first step, Westover facilitated the development of a
Three-Year Strategy Map, working with the senior staff of Lifetime Benefit
Solutions, and reflecting input from key members of the parent company. The Map
reflected an updated Mission and Vision, as well as measurable objectives in
four perspectives: Financial, Customer, Internal Processes and People and Culture.

### Results
The Map was approved and presented to all employees of the
affiliate company and its board by President Tom Cauthorn. The employees
appreciated seeing their roles in the larger context of the company’s
direction. It was agreed that, as a next step, Westover would facilitate the development
of a Strategic Plan, building on the Strategy Map.
