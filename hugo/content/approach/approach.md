Westover works with companies in a range of industries experiencing disruption, particularly financial services, but also healthcare, museums and others. In this fast-moving world, even successful companies benefit from stepping back and taking a longer-term perspective on factors such as emerging competitors, new technology, evolving customer expectations, and their impact on the business model, organization and board of directors. 

A longer-term perspective often drives the company to refine its strategic path, and reflect it in a Strategy Map, Strategic Plan, and tools to help the board become and remain a Strategic Asset.

Westover offers a full range of strategy services, customized to fit client needs and resources, working with senior staff, board members, and others as appropriate. The services frequently include offsite meetings facilitated by Ms. Byrd, as well as advice on communication and execution. 

The primary consultant is Susan Powell Byrd; other resources are brought into engagements as needed, tapping into her network of seasoned professionals.

The 3-step engagement process is straightforward:

* Meet with the prospective client to ask questions and discuss concerns and goals
* Review pertinent client information and clarify desired outcome, timeframe, and resources
* Submit a proposal, incorporate client feedback and confirm the engagement
