**Strategy Assessment**<br/>
Westover’s objective strategy assessment helps clients appreciate how gaps in their Strategic Plan may present barriers to sustainable growth. Clients may choose to engage Westover for additional services, or to address the gaps identified on their own.

**One-Page Strategy Maps**<br/>
Westover works with companies to articulate the mission, vision, and values and establish measurable objectives for four key perspectives on a one-page Strategy Map. The Strategy Map brings needed clarity and transparency to the company’s priorities and is an effective tool to communicate with and align the organization along the company’s strategic path.

**Deep Dive Strategic Plans**<br/>
Where a more in-depth approach is needed, Westover works with clients to expand on the Strategy Map and develop more detailed, well-considered 3 to 5-year Strategic Plans, including specific Strategic Initiatives, accountability, metrics and timeframe. Advice on communication and execution is also provided.

**Strategy Execution**<br/>
Strategy execution is a challenge for many organizations and outside resources are sometimes needed. Westover provides leadership and expertise to clients that may require support to accomplish and/or update aspects of their Strategic Plan.

**Board Performance Enhancement**<br/>
A hallmark of successful organizations is a board that is a Strategic Asset. Westover works with boards to develop and implement processes and tools to aid the board in becoming and remaining a Strategic Asset for the company.
