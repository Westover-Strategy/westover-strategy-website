Westover Strategy works with both for-profit and not-for-profit organizations in a variety of industries, including healthcare, financial services, fine art and more on confidential strategy consulting engagements that are customized to fit clients’ needs and priorities. 

Key offerings include:

*	Strategy Assessment – Organizations sometimes benefit from an evaluation of strategy and execution plans by an objective third party.  Westover provides such services, including identification of critical gaps and recommendations on how to address them. Westover’s strategy assessment helps clients appreciate how gaps in their strategic plan may present barriers to sustainable growth.

*	Strategy Map Development – Westover works with the senior team and board to articulate and/or update the organization’s mission, vision and values and establish measurable objectives for four key perspectives in a one-page Strategy Map. The process may include an offsite facilitated by Westover as well as advice on effective communication of the Map to key stakeholders.

*	Strategic Planning – Westover works with clients to develop detailed, well-considered three-to-five year Strategic Plans, ideally expanding upon a Strategy Map as the plan’s foundation. The plan reflects internal and external assessments of the client organization and industry and articulates strategic initiatives designed to accomplish key objectives, along with associated metrics, resource requirements and projected financials. The process may include an offsite facilitated by Westover.

*	Strategy Execution – Westover provides leadership and resources to clients who have developed a strategic plan and require external support in prioritizing and accomplishing objectives established through the planning process.

*	High-Performing Boards of Directors – Westover works with Boards of Directors to help them become high-performing boards that provide the underlying organization a competitive advantage. During such engagements, Westover works with the board to develop a customized list of substantive issues reflected in a board calendar, establish expectations for board members and address board composition, culture and engagement. The process may include a board retreat facilitated by Westover.

* Strategic Projects and Initiatives - Westover manages strategic projects that may require expertise not available within an organization or that require supplemental resources for project management and completion.
