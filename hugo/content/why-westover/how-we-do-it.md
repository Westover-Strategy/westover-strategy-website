Introductory meetings are held at which the client describes its concerns, issues, needs and priorities. Westover requests and reviews material in advance of the initial meetings in order to formulate questions to clarify the client’s issues during the initial meetings. 

After the initial meetings, once the client is ready to formalize an engagement, Westover develops a proposal that includes confirmation of client needs, specific deliverables for both Westover and the client, timeframe and pricing.

Westover’s preferred approach to pricing is to establish a fixed fee for the engagement to be paid on a specified schedule. Consulting fees are established as appropriate to the engagement, on a project or retainer basis. After the proposal is discussed and finalized, Westover and the client sign a Professional Services Agreement and a Statement of Work.
