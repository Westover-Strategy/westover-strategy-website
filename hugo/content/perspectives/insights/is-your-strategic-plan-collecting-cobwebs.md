Strategic
planning has lost favor in some companies. Sometimes, it is because the strategic
plan was developed hastily, without using a thoughtful, disciplined process. And,
the end result can wind up on a shelf collecting cobwebs, with the team losing
faith in strategic planning itself.

Yet,
in today’s fast-moving world, companies that do not plan for the future are
vulnerable. As renowned professor and author Michael Porter wrote,
“Strategy is about making choices, trade-offs; it's about deliberately choosing
to be different.”

\\

To develop an
effective strategic plan, there are 7 key questions to consider before you
begin. These questions help pierce through the day-to-day frenzy and go
straight to the areas of needed focus for your organization. By identifying the
opportunities - and barriers - to success, you’ll begin to lay the framework
for a compelling strategic plan.

\*\*Key Strategic Planning
Questions \*\*

1\.     Do your employees understand
your mission, vision, values and strategy?

2\.     What are the major current
and future issues facing your company?

3\.     Is your industry undergoing
significant disruption?

4\.     Are your company’s financial
returns acceptable to your stakeholders?

5\.     Who are your target
customers and what is your value proposition to them?

6\.     Do your company’s
operational processes support your goals?

7\.     Are the culture and
organization aligned with your goals?

While
the answers to these questions begin to get at the *what* of a useful strategic plan, just as important is *how* you develop the plan. Here are 2
suggestions for setting up a process that starts, and stays, on the right
track.

\*\* \*\*

·      
**Involve a cross-section of
internal and external stakeholders to develop the strategic plan.**

A
good place to start is to select a group of 6 – 8 senior employees to work with
the CEO to talk through the 7 planning questions above and develop a Strategy
Map. The Strategy Map reflects the company’s path forward over the next 3 years
on a single page. The Strategy Map should include the company’s mission,
vision, values and strategy, as well as objectives in 4 key perspectives:
financial, customer, internal processes and people and culture. The Map will
provide a framework for growth, prioritization and decision-making.

·      
**Establish a disciplined
process to develop, implement and assess progress on the plan.**

Once
the Map is completed, broaden the process to include key players from staff,
the Board of Directors and trusted external experts in areas where the company
lacks depth. Establish a process for the team to expand on the Strategy Map and
develop a Strategic Plan for the next three years. The depth of the effort
should be dictated by the answers to the 7 questions above.

Engaging
an experienced, objective third-party advisor to guide the process often yields
the best results.

If you
take the time to develop a thoughtful strategic plan, involve the key
stakeholders, and implement it with discipline, it will be a useful tool to
help guide your team and the company to a successful future.
