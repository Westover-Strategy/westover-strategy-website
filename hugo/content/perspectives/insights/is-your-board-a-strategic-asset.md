In today’s complex and rapidly changing world, boards are under increasing pressure to be effective. A board that is a strategic asset has the critical skills, expertise and dedication to advise the company on a range of relevant subjects, and provides a competitive advantage by contributing proactively to the company’s successful operation and growth.<!--more-->

Yet, without clear expectations, policies, practices and timely information, board members may struggle, and the board may actually be a drag on the company.

To enhance your board’s performance, here are eight questions to uncover the critical areas where it may be falling short of performing as a strategic asset: 

1. Does the **board composition** reflect a diverse mix of relevant industry and functional expertise as well as temperaments that blend together productively? 
2. Have governance policies been defined, including **clear expectations** of the board? 
3. Does the board have mechanisms, such as term limits, that provide for the **orderly refreshment of board membership**?
4. Has the board agreed on a short list of **substantive topics** on which it will focus?
5. Does the company have a well-considered **strategic plan**, updated regularly, that anticipates and addresses risks and opportunities?
6. Does the board **debate critical issues** vigorously and **coalesce around decisions**? 
7. Does the board have an effective **committee structure**, populated by members with the expertise and commitment to do the committees’ work? 
8. Does the board evaluate its performance regularly and strive for **continuous improvement**?

The answers to these questions may suggest that it’s time to take steps to enhance board performance. Discuss the issue with the board chair and establish a path to make your board a strategic asset. Board members want to help the companies they serve, while also providing proper oversight; yet, sometimes the company – or other board members – make it difficult to do so. 

For optimal results, engage a trusted advisor whose credentials include solid experience working with and on boards, and the discretion, objectivity, expertise and cultural fit to work with your board.

Serving on a well-functioning board is a privilege. A responsible board will appreciate the opportunity to enhance its performance, as much as you will appreciate your board becoming – and remaining – a strategic asset.
